## Setup

### 1. GitHub Token

The action requires a GitHub token with access to GitHub Projects V2.
**Important**: `GITHUB_TOKEN` has limited access to organization projects and
may not work for all scenarios.

#### Using GITHUB_TOKEN (Limited Support)

The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` can only access projects in certain cases:

- **Repository projects**: Works if the project is linked to the repository
- **Organization projects**: May fail with "Could not resolve to ProjectV2"
  error

Set minimal permissions in your workflow:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
```

#### Using Personal Access Token (Recommended for Organization Projects)

For reliable access to organization projects, create a personal access token
with:

- `read:org` (to access organization resources)
- `read:project` (to read project data)

1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens >
   Fine-grained tokens
2. Create a token with the above permissions
3. Add it as a repository secret named `GITHUB_PAT`
4. Use `github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_PAT }}` in your workflow

**For agglayer users**: The pre-configured token already has the necessary
permissions.

### 2. Slack App Setup

Instead of using webhooks, this action uses a Slack App which is more secure and
easier to set up:

#### Option A: For agglayer Organization (Instant Use)

If you're using this action within the `agglayer` GitHub organization, you can
use it immediately with the pre-configured organization secret:

```yaml
- name: Send Project Summary to Slack
  uses: agglayer/gha-notify-gh-project@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # PAT if org project, see below
    project-url: 'https://github.com/orgs/agglayer/projects/1'
          slack-bot-token: ${{ secrets.SLACK_APP_TOKEN_AGGLAYER_NOTIFY_GH_PROJECT }}
      slack-channel: '#your-channel'
      done-items-days: 2  # Optional: Show Done items from last 2 days (default: 1)
```

Just invite the bot to your desired channel with `/invite @Agglayer Github Project Notifier`
and you're ready to go!

#### Option B: Use the Pre-built Slack App (Other Organizations)

1. **Install the App**: Click the "Add to Slack" button below to install the
   pre-built app to your workspace

   [![Add to Slack](https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png)](https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&scope=chat:write&user_scope=)

2. **Get the Bot Token**: After installation, you'll receive a Bot User OAuth
   Token that starts with `xoxb-`

3. **Add the Token as a Secret**: In your GitHub repository, go to Settings >
   Secrets and Variables > Actions, then add a new secret named
   `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` with your bot token

4. **Invite the Bot**: You must manually invite the bot to each channel where
   you want to receive summaries by typing `/invite @GitHub Projects Bot` in the
   channel

#### Option C: Create Your Own Slack App

1. **Create a Slack App**: Go to
   [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new app
2. **Configure OAuth Scopes**: In "OAuth & Permissions", add this Bot Token
   Scope:
   - `chat:write` - Send messages to channels the bot is a member of
3. **Install the App**: Click "Install to Workspace" and authorize the app
4. **Get the Bot Token**: Copy the "Bot User OAuth Token" (starts with `xoxb-`)
5. **Add as Secret**: Add the token as `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` in your GitHub
   repository secrets
6. **Invite the Bot**: You must manually invite the bot to each channel where
   you want to receive summaries by typing `/invite @YourBotName` in the channel

### 3. Project URL

The action supports both organization and user projects:

- Organization projects: `https://github.com/orgs/your-org/projects/1`
- User projects: `https://github.com/users/your-username/projects/1`

### 4. Channel Configuration

You can specify the channel in several ways:

- Channel name: `#general`
- Channel ID: `C1234567890`
- Direct message: `@username`

**Important**: The bot must be manually invited to each channel before it can
post messages. Use `/invite @YourBotName` in the target channel.

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not resolve to a ProjectV2 with the number X"

This error occurs when the GitHub token cannot access the specified project.
Common causes:

1. **Project doesn't exist**: Verify the project URL and number are correct
2. **Using GITHUB_TOKEN with organization projects**: `GITHUB_TOKEN` has limited
   access to organization projects
3. **Missing permissions**: The token lacks necessary permissions

**Solutions:**

- **For organization projects**: Use a Personal Access Token instead of
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- **Check project URL**: Ensure the project exists at the specified URL
- **Verify project number**: The number in the URL should match an existing
  project

### Project Access Permissions

- **Repository projects**: `GITHUB_TOKEN` usually works
- **Organization projects**: Requires Personal Access Token with `read:org` and
  `read:project` permissions
- **Private projects**: Ensure the token has access to the
  organization/repository

## Example Output

The action will send a message to Slack that looks like this:

```
